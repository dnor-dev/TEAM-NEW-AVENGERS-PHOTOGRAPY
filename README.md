# TEAM-NEW-AVENGERS-PHOTOGRAPY
This Repo is for Team New Team Avengers envato team working on Photography Template.

Once you are assigned a task on clubhouse, create a branch on your local git and only
push to that branch. If you push to any other branch, you will be heavily penalized.

Typical way to do so: 

● run: git pull origin develop - You must pull from develop before or after checkout

● git checkout -b feat/user-login - You are in the feat/user-login branch now
To push to github;

● git add .

● git commit -m "feat: implemented user login

● git push origin feat/user-login - note how it ends with a branch.

On github, you must make a PR to the develop branch, any PR to the master branch must be
closed with immediate alacrity.

When making a PR, your PR is expected to have the following: 

● What is the task completed ?

● What the PR actually does ?

● How can this feature be tested, put link to a hosted verson.

Your commit messages should follow a consistent pattern:
Remember, chore, feature, bug

So i do not want to see stuff like I tried my best in your commit messages;

For a feature: git commit -m "feat: implemented user log-in

For a bug: git commit -m "bug: fixed inconsistency in log in screen"

For a chore: git commit -m "chore: updated read me to include API endpoints"
